    "## ABSTRACT\n",
    "\n",
    "Contained below is a functional script that webscrapes wikipedia and Teamwork Online - the best sports database available. The script is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "First the libraries are loaded for scraping and data cleaning. Then Teamwork Online is scraped through a variety of user -defined functions and passed into the list: job_list. \n",
    "\n",
    "This list is then made into a dataframe and validated through a series of agile development cycles which included visualizing the data table at each step. In the end the final table is saved into job_posting_teamwork_df. Cleaning included many partions, replacements, typecasting and reindexing as well as other steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the data was passed into other dataframes such as job_requirements_df_final which contains an exploded list of job requirements and qualifications scraped from Teamwork Online. Another dataframe made was called Company_Team_df and contained the distinct companies and an encoded ID number. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further scraping came into play when all major leagues' (MLS, MLB, NFL, NHL, and NBA) wiki pages were scraped to get all team information. This data was then cleaned and merged with the actual companies so that those that did have a team match would have that info. Many NULLS occured and were cleaned as well as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the database was connected to and all data was succesfully imported. "
